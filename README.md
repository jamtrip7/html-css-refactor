## Description

This website will show users how to Optimize Search Engine use, better Manage Online Reputation, and introduces you to Social Media Marketing.
In addition you can also find info on Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management.
The main purpose was to better assist users with basic info related to business practices on the internet.
I learned how to structure HTML to build the layout, CSS to style the website and give it personality, and VS Code to bring both together and give the website life and character. My project will stand out with the added features such as "Back to Top", and links to helpful videos for README creation.

#### Technologies Used
